# 1. Motivation

I know how to access a subset of backend data using REST. GraphQL, as per my understanding, is a way to use just one endpoint for all possible data access combinations.

GraphQL is important for backend data which is split across many tables, and using a multiple endpoint approach hinders abstraction as well as efficiency of data access.

In short,

REST => multiple functions with no arguments.

GraphQL => single function with a large input domain.
